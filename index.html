                <p>“How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?“<br></p>
                <p> Winston thought. “By making him suffer”, he said.<br></p>
                <p>“Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he
                    is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human
                    minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see,
                    then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the
                    old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled
                    upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will
                    be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours
                    is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and
                    self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy – everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of
                    thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and
                    between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer.
                    But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth,
                    as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality
                    like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the <a href="abstract.html" class="link">orgasm</a>. Our
                    neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big
                    Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art,
                    no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no
                    distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.
                    All competing pleasures will be destroyed.” </p>

                <h3 class="head-small-desc">yes, i am happy but should i be?</h3>
                <p>Society thinks we should, cos duh! That’s when we are the most
                    productive and the current socioeconomic system of human civilizations demand output production. But
                    the question still remains, is happiness the only thing we can strive for in life. And again yes,
                    out brains want us to be happy at all times because from an evolutionary standpoint, life is all
                    about reproduction. And happy humans tend to have sex even more, so yay for the continuation of
                    life. But there’s the thing. So what, life continues. And so what if it doesn't continue. I mean,
                    life is only what we consider reality. We don’t call an asparagus is having having a happy or
                    depressing life. Then what’s the difference between us and it. We both are made of stuff and that’s
                    it. We have something called though but materially, not even that matters. As it’s just a
                    manipulation of electrowaves through nerve cells which again is just made of some more stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Human beings are the only animal that forms ideas about their world. We perceive it by not through
                    our bodies but through our minds. We humans must agree on what to believe, and what not to. Because
                    of this individuals tend to believe what the collective believes. Thus knowledge begins. We believe
                    what our minds can comprehend and interpret what we think is right or inaugurates. And from it the
                    schools of thought sprout out. What we cannot comprehend we do not believe but we do not let it be.
                    What we cannot understand, we imagine. All of what we know, is in a way an imagination. A fragment
                    of creativity. Which even then is still only an idea of the human mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Objectively everything means nothing. But humans, the obsessively pattern seeking animals, they
                    can't comprehend the nothingness. So what'd they do. They created everything out of nothing. And
                    consider that everything is everything, even after they had forgotten where those ideas came from;
                    creativity. Every delusion follows this simple path. It starts like every other though, as an idea.
                    But the longer you think about it the more it infects, like a disease. Until you think it's the only
                    truth that exists. Here rationality is triumphed by something far more powerful. Ignorance. You may
                    not even notice it to begin with but just because you close your eyes doesn't mean that, reality
                    ceases to exist. You just can't see it. As it is still an idea. Like every other idea that pops into
                    existence. But you see, an idea alone isn't enough to be called a delusion. To thrive other more
                    rational ideas must be rejected. Only then can a delusion be called insanity.

                <h2 class="head-small">The Final Question</h2>
                <h3 class="head-small-desc">if life is meaningless, should we even continue to live it?</h3>
                <p>
                    The question of existence is a question that many of whom who have had a period of emotional
                    turmoil, depression or a
                    very uncontrollable mind have very much likely asked. These types of questions are not only present
                    for the melodramatic
                    but for the intensely curious as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all, we all know from within that we exist, but is it really true that we exist, how can we
                    ever precisely know
                    that we exist? Or what if our senses are deceiving us?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The doubt of existence has been a prevailing suspension of belief by many intellectuals of both the
                    past and the
                    present. Since the day we started to question the validity of our senses, this existential question
                    has been a
                    power-horse in the existential crisis’. As our senses are very easily fooled, and the information
                    gathered is very
                    easily interpreted by our brain in the utter most imaginative ways at times where there is a lack of
                    data to conclude
                    with, it is not surprising that we can be easily deceived by fragments and fantasies conjured by our
                    natural
                    imagination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humans determine existence from the feelings we feel and from the fact that we can feel. Our senses
                    are the gateway to
                    the outside world, it is of them that we could even comprehend the existence of an exterior world
                    other than the
                    interior consciousness. It is of the validity of such senses that the world is based upon and it is
                    because of their
                    inaccuracies that science now resorts to math and mechanical instruments for much detailed
                    measurements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Rene Descartes once said, “Cogito ergo sum - I think, therefore I exist”, he discovered the only
                    thing that he cannot
                    ever doubt. What he cannot doubt is that he is doubting. Essentially, I exist if I doubt that I
                    exist. My doubt that I
                    exist proves that I exist, for I must exist to be able to doubt. Therefore, I cannot doubt that I
                    exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the question that arises when one is definite ‘I exist’, is, "why do 'I' exist?". The
                    primal purpose of both
                    non-intelligent and intelligent life (even if there is a difference or not) is to reproduce and
                    spread. This is the
                    reason as to why we nurture and produce offspring. Biological reproduction is the ultimate goal of
                    life in a biological
                    perspective of the world. Animals have very different traits that ensure the production of
                    offspring: for example,
                    survival, we survive so that we could exist until we can spread and contribute to our gene pool. But
                    for what reason? If
                    this is the ultimate purpose, then why did life evolve intelligence? – as it is evident that even
                    non-intelligent life
                    is perfectly able to survive for vast amounts of time and still be able to dominate without building
                    kingdoms and
                    inventing materialistic objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This finally leads to the existential question, for why life even exists in the first place. Because
                    from our present
                    knowledge about the world, there is no cosmic reason for why life should exist at all because how
                    can a reason exist if
                    all its purpose is to reproduce and propagate. Simply there is no reason for it to have existed nor
                    a reason as to why
                    it should exist further. Because, even if life existed, what is the purpose of it. There is no
                    cosmic good or bad to
                    contribute to, there is no hidden reason as to why we should reproduce and nurture children, hell if
                    we go further,
                    there is no reason to let life exist into the future as well. No matter what the question is one
                    must accept that life
                    does indeed exist (though for no reason at all) and will continue to exist (also for no reason at
                    all).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cultures, religions, and society will continue to blindly promote existence as some Godly
                    incarnation of fortune and
                    blessing, but that does not in any way change the fact that such promotions are just delusions in
                    itself while in
                    comparison to the reality of the universe we inhabit; if there is no reason for life to exist why
                    should it even be
                    considered worthwhile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As this essay continuously surfaces, the philosophical perspective drawn upon here is of the school
                    of nihilism (nihil
                    in Latin means nothing at all, and nihilism is an extreme form of skepticism) , which understands
                    that both life and the
                    vast cosmic monstrosity we call the universe has no meaning and even the fact that nothing has no
                    meaning, has no
                    meaning. If nothing matters then, even the realization that nothing matters doesn’t matter; the
                    point is that there is
                    no point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we think about the meaning of everything by technically stripping off all the human emotional
                    tendencies and biases
                    (the absurdities) which guide us in ways that our primal instincts force us to follow, which is the
                    path of least
                    resistance - and questioning the purposelessness of life in a biological sense is highly resistive
                    against the
                    naturalist fundamentals that govern our ways of life. One of which is the instinct of survival. We
                    humans have developed
                    a great many techniques that account for our survival. And that's aided by a constant strive for
                    self-comfort and power.
                    Power is the fundamental drive for control over the behaviour of both humanity and the natural and
                    artificial
                    surroundings. thrive for the order of their desire. To have the upper hand. To be the alpha.

                <p>
                    All the while on the other hand it is the brain’s reward system that is responsible for all the
                    positive, dopamine
                    filled pleasure reactions we react to. The primal purpose of the pleasure system is to reward the
                    body for doing actions
                    that our brain things is good for us by making a decision based off of our sensory input. And the
                    conscious mind is
                    drawn to that subconscious cue cos of the pleasure it comes with. It is the best organism control
                    methods in the world.
                    Not control by fear nor pain but pleasure itself. In Adolus Huxley’s novel Brave new World, he
                    crafted a totalitarian
                    regime made of pure pleasure, and the citizens are fully influenced by it. Because of it the state
                    can control the
                    people like Muppets cos what’s there to stop it. No opposition is willing to give up pleasure for
                    hardship. The result
                    is quite obvious a totalitarian government with total domination by an illusion of happiness based
                    upon a false
                    abstraction of happiness. Humans crave for pleasure which is why we even do the things we do in the
                    first place. So once
                    we get a taste for it we never want to go out of it again. Even in the knowledge of pleasure is
                    imminent and only a
                    disillusionment, almost no one listened as we are hogging dopamine addicts. When tasting the full
                    flavor of the pleasure
                    system one can never assume a way out into a world of pain and hardship.

                    Nevertheless, we find that there is no meaning that exists to be found even though the utter human
                    yearning for meaning
                    still exists. No matter how much were convinced of the lack of it, yet we continue to search for it,
                    hoping we'll find
                    something in return. This simply is a paradox; the complex paradox of absurdism.

                    The great human delusion is not some conspiracy run by the Catholic church or by a corrupted
                    government or the
                    Illuminati per say. But a limitation that has been inbuilt into the human condition throughout
                    millions of years or
                    evolution. This suspension of mind from the reality is one of the key factors in keeping us sane.

                    From a biological perspective the thought of meaninglessness developing in the mind of the animal is
                    a counter to even
                    the basic fundamentals that the human animal is built for. Reproduction. One who understands the
                    inevitability of life
                    understands the reasons for the cravings and fantasies of the mind. Realising that even love, the
                    fundamental quality
                    that deeply binds the infinite bond that ties humans too is just an illusion that exists for a
                    purely biological
                    necessity. Coming into such a purely rational conclusion is quite harming for the regeneration of a
                    particular species,
                    therefore we have inbuilt subconscious mechanisms which ensure the elimination (or thinning) of a
                    possibility of ending
                    up as a critique of the meaning of life itself. Some of these mechanisms are built right into the
                    social systems we
                    inhabit on - as the social paradigms we live upon were not created by some ancient extraterrestrial
                    civilization but by
                    the all familiar mere mortals for themselves.
