        <p>“To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies,
            to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in
            both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that
            democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was
            necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then
            promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself -- that was the
            ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the
            act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of
            doublethink.” </p><br>

        <p>“How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?“<br><br>

            Winston thought. “By making him suffer”, he said.<br><br>
            
            “Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he
            is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human
            minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see,
            then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the
            old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled
            upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will
            be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours
            is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and
            self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy – everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of
            thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and
            between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer.
            But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth,
            as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality
            like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the <a href="#" class="link">orgasm</a>. Our
            neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big
            Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art,
            no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no
            distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.
            All competing pleasures will be destroyed.” </p>
