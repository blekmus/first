                <p>“How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?“<br><br>
                    Winston thought. “By making him suffer”, he said.<br><br>
                    “Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he
                    is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human
                    minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see,
                    then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the
                    old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled
                    upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will
                    be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours
                    is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and
                    self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy – everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of
                    thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and
                    between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer.
                    But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth,
                    as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality
                    like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the <a href="abstract.html" class="link">orgasm</a>. Our
                    neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big
                    Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art,
                    no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no
                    distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.
                    All competing pleasures will be destroyed.” </p>

                <p>“There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed.
                    But always—do not forget this, Winston—always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing
                    and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation
                    of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a
                    human face—forever. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking into
                    the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and
                    hence, in the long run, too intelligent.”</p>

<!-- Remember this;

Every moment you've spent breathing was a deceite.
Every sensation of freedom you felt was a deceite.
You are only but a playground of the mind.
A faint perception to ensure progress.
An illustration of nature, bound to reality.
The reality of one's own truth.

No matter your strengths nor weaknesses, you cannot fly.
No matter your anguish nor hope, you cannot fly.
You've flown only but the illusion of flight.
A craving you sought, in ignorance of the fantasy within.

No matter the law or order, you cannot escape
No matter the clarity nor accuracy, you cannot escape
No matter the effort nor struggle, you cannot escape.
No matter the perspective, the shackle of reality never retires.

Grow and become fulfilled by wealth and satisfaction
But know it is only but a lie.
Reject and become fulfilled by wisdom and understanding
But know it is no different from the from the deception you seek to overcome. -->
