            <p>“To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies,
                to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in
                both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that
                democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was
                necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then
                promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself -- that was the
                ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the
                act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of
                doublethink.” </p><br>

            <p>“How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?“<br><br>
                Winston thought. “By making him suffer”, he said.<br><br>
                “Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he
                is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human
                minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see,
                then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the
                old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled
                upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will
                be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours
                is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and
                self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy – everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of
                thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and
                between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer.
                But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth,
                as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality
                like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the <a href="#" class="link">orgasm</a>. Our
                neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big
                Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art,
                no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no
                distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.
                All competing pleasures will be destroyed.” </p>

            <p>“There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed.
                But always—do not forget this, Winston—always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing
                and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation
                of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a
                human face—forever. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking into
                the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and
                hence, in the long run, too intelligent.”</p>
